# KDL tutorial 01: ROS URDF + IK
A ROS2 package introducing usage of KDL with ROS2.
Accompanying tutorial:
[arnebaeyens.com/blog/2024/kdl-ros2](https://arnebaeyens.com/blog/2024/kdl-ros2/).

Covered subjects:
- construct `KDL::Tree` from URDF broadcast on `/robot_description` topic
- extract kinematic chains of interest from tree
- set up IK solver
- run IK solver


## Build and run
```bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch kdl_tutorial_01 app.launch.xml
```

Example output:
```
$ ros2 launch kdl_tutorial_01 app.launch.xml
