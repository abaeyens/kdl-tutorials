# KDL tutorial 01: URDF + IK

In this tutorial/blogpost, we will go through setting up KDL in ROS2,
constructing the KDL kinematic tree from the `/robot_description` topic
(i.e. using URDF), and solving an inverse kinematics case.

Subjects:
- construct `KDL::Tree` from URDF broadcast on `/robot_description` topic
- extract kinematic chains of interest from tree
- set up IK solver
- run IK solver

## Build and run
```bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch kdl_tutorial_01 app.launch.xml
```

Example output:
```
$ ros2 launch kdl_tutorial_01 app.launch.xml
